# Pipelines
Three pipelines are coded in the shared files:
1. chiporcs
2. dnascent
3. atlas

Each pipeline is composed of steps that should be executed in a linear fashion way. The order of the steps are indicated by numbers. If two steps can be executed in parallel, the number is followed by a letter (e.g.: `5a`, `5b`).

```bash
echo "CÃ³digo em Bash."
```

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].
