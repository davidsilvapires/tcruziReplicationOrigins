# _Trypanosoma cruzi_ Replication Origins
> Text that is a quote

This repository contains scripts relative to experiments published at the following paper: **Integrating high-throughput analysis to create an atlas of replication origins in _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in the context of genome structure and variability** (_to be submitted_).

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Pipelines
Three pipelines are coded in the shared files:
1. chiporcs
2. dnascent
3. atlas

Each pipeline is composed of steps that should be executed in a linear fashion way. The order of the steps are indicated by numbers. If two steps can be executed in parallel, the number is followed by a letter (e.g.: `5a`, `5b`).

```bash
echo "CÃ³digo em Bash."
```

## Chip-seq of ORCs pipeline

## DNAscent pipeline
