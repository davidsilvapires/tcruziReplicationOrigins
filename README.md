## Visão geral

This repository contains scripts relative to experiments published at the following paper: **Integrating high-throughput analysis to create an atlas of replication origins in _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in the context of genome structure and variability** (_to be submitted_).

We present three different pipelines:
1. **Chiporcs:** ChIP-seq pipeline of Orc1Cdc6 in _Trypanosoma cruzi_.
2. **DNAscent:** Nascent DNA pipeline.
3. **Atlas:** The construction of a dataset that combines the results of the implemented pipelines.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Pipelines
Three pipelines are coded in the shared files:
1. chiporcs
2. dnascent
3. atlas

Each pipeline is composed of steps that should be executed in a linear fashion way. The order of the steps are indicated by numbers. If two steps can be executed in parallel, the number is followed by a letter (e.g.: `5a`, `5b`).

```bash
echo "Código em Bash."
```

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].
