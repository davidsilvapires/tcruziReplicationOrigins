# tcruziReplicationOrigins
This repository contains scripts relative to experiments published at the following paper: Integrating high-throughput analysis to create an atlas of replication origins in Trypanosoma cruzi in the context of genome structure and variability (to be submitted).

# Pipelines
Three pipelines are coded in the shared files:
1. chiporcs
2. dnascent
3. atlas

Each pipeline is composed of steps that should be executed in a linear fashion. The order of the steps are indicated by numbers. If two step can be executed in parallel, its number is followed by a letter (e.g.: 5a, 5b).
